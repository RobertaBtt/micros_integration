# micros_integration
From Apache Axis2 to an extract of an implementation of the integration with  MICROS Symphony Oracle Food and Beverage.

This code is just an example on how to start the implementation
of the integration with MICROS Symphony Food and Beverage.

Packages don't reflect the exact huerarchy of the original project.

You can start to work on the integration only 
if you have the Description Definitio of the Service, 
alias WSDL.

An example of what I am talking about is the file:

[[SymphonyPosApiWeb.xml]]
